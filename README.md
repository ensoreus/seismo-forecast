## Usage
### Train a model
At start, you have to create and train a model. Here we have a `train.py` script. 
You can use prepared `mags-1998-2022.csv` file which contains all the events around Vrancha mountains in a 5 degrees radius. 
Or you can use just make your own magnitudes history with latest events by removing `mags-1998-2022.csv`.
To run building and training model, run
`python train.py`
